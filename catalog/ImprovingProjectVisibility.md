## Comments

1. One approach to this would be to work within the project team to research contemporary projects and create an "ideal plan" for 
project visibility.
2. Identify and create an initial set of communication mechanisms, such as a website, wiki, blogs and contact mailing lists 
within a specified time frame.
3. Develop and implement a plan to publicize the work to the project's community (e.g. for a research community, through posters 
and research publications) within a specified time frame.
