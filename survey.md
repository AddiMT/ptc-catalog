# Rate Your Project Survey

Brought you by the [IDEAS-ECP project](https://ideas-productivity.org) and the [PSIP Development Team](https://bssw.io/psip).

## Why are Software Team Practices Important?

Software engineering is a systematic approach to the design, development, and maintenance of a software system. Building reliable and maintainable software is difficult and expensive. By adopting a systematic approach to software development, it is possible to maximize the cost effectiveness of the software system.

### Key Objectives of Software Engineering

Maintainability := Should be able to evolve to meet changing requirements
Correctness := Correctly implements the user requirements
Adaptability := Can be changed to adapt to new system or user constraints
Reusability := Modules can be readily reused to develop new software products
Testability := Should be testable with minimal effort
Portability := Can be cost effectively transferred from one computer system to another
Reliability := Should be able to perform its desired function over an arbitrary time period

### How Does Your Team Score?

Use the following survey to rate your team practices.

Score | Description
-----:|:-----------
0 | Oh oh. Now is a good time to take a look at PSIP (see below) for identifying and tracking practices that could be used or improved.
<10 | Good start! A process improvement strategy such as PSIP (see below) could be a good way to get you to the next level.
10-100 | Cool! Adopting advanced practices can be challenging without a process improvement strategy such as PSIP (see below.).
100-400 | Impressive! Seems like you have really good practices already in place. Have you thought about how you could improve from here?
\>400 | Wow, you rock! Would you be interested in writing a blog article on your software engineering practices?

### Where To Go Next?

Regardless of your score, there is always room for improvement. One way to improve your projectâ€™s practices is to look at a software improvement strategy, such as the Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP). PSIP is a lightweight process that uses Progress Tracking Cards (PTCs) to track the improvements you are making. For more information, see <https://bssw.io/psip>.

## Project Self-Survey

The form below shows a range of practices that increase in maturity. Check the practices that your project already uses, score each basic practice as 1 point, intermediate as 10 points and advanced as 100 points. Write the score in the box below.

### Better Development

1.  Revision Control

    -   [ ] Uses revision control system such as Git
    -   [ ] Uses a basic development workflow (e.g., basic Git workflow)
    -   [ ] Uses an advanced development workflow (e.g., Gitflow)

2.  Code Reviews

    -   [ ] Ad-hoc code reviews
    -   [ ] Regular code reviews (e.g., weekly meetings)
    -   [ ] Code reviews automated in workflow (e.g., via pull requests)

3.  Issue Tracking

    -   [ ] Manual issue tracking via email or other medium
    -   [ ] Dedicated issue tracking system being used
    -   [ ] Integrated issue tracking  (e.g., pull requests)

4.  Deployment

    -   [ ] Manual deployment using a script
    -   [ ] Deployment as part of development workflow with manual intervention
    -   [ ] Continuous deployment

5.  Documentation

    -   [ ] Ad-hoc text files
    -   [ ] Code and documentation are cross referenced and updated when committed to repository
    -   [ ] Integrated with the package release workflow

### Better Planning

1.  Development Process

    -   [ ] Has development process but it is based on ad-hoc rules
    -   [ ] Employs an iterative development process
    -   [ ] Uses an agile development methodology

2.  Due Diligence

    -   [ ] Formal guidelines for accepting contributions
    -   [ ] Clearly defined standards for coding and documentation
    -   [ ] Provenance and license checking for contributions

3.  Software Design

    -   [ ] Development guidelines include design in the process
    -   [ ] A modeling language is employed for key aspects of the project
    -   [ ] Visual modeling using a graphical representation to capture design

4.  Onboarding

    -   [ ] Initial onboarding process is documented
    -   [ ] Used for supervisors for new hires
    -   [ ] Used for all personnel changes

5.  Requirements Analysis

    -   [ ] Development guidelines include requirements gathering
    -   [ ] Formal requirements gathering is undertaken as part of the project
    -   [ ] Requirements management process is employed

### Better Reliability

1.  Testing

    -   [ ] Comparison used to create system-level no-change tests
    -   [ ] Unit testing for refactored and new code
    -   [ ] Continuous integration

2.  Reproducibility

    -   [ ] Publication of code
    -   [ ] Inclusion of data when code is published
    -   [ ] Automatic provenance capture system is employed
